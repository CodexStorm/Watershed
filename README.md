# Watershed Algorithm

The first workflow describes semi-automated segmentation approach which makes sure that all fluorescent structures are examined in order to reduce selection bias and improve the resolution of fine comparisons\cite. We began by opening an image in Fiji. Selected "View stack with: Hyperstack" and "Color mode: Grayscale" in the "Bio-Formats Import Options" dialog box. Then, based on the marker channel(s), we identified a region from a single z-plane or a projection that may be utilized as a standardized ROI across specimens. Preprocessing was done on the channel that was utilized to capture the structures of interest. On the created and stored preprocessed picture, I used the interactive h-maxima watershed tool to segment structures of interest. The structures of interest were then retrieved from the watershed findings.

In the graphing program, I created a scatter plot. Each data point represents an interesting structure, with the intensity of the first fluorophore being the "x value" and the intensity of the second fluorophore being the "y value" measured from each particle. To establish the quadrants, set gating thresholds for each fluorophore.
